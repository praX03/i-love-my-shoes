# I love my shoes

Recently I have developed a new addiction for shoes. But shoes are ultimately materialistic things which cannot be taken everywhere every time.
In order to appreciate my new love for shoes and my undying thirst to create new things I've created a wall of fame for my shoes.

I've only update two of my recent purchases here, would be adding more, when I get time.

*FAQs:*
1) How bored were you on a scale of 1-10?
Ans: Probably a 6-6.35
2) Did you not have anything to do at all?
Ans: Ironically I had heck lot of things to do but I rather decided to pile them and work on this.
